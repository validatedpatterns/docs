== Create a GitHub account
Before you can contribute to Hybrid Cloud Patterns documentation, you must
https://www.github.com/join[sign up for a GitHub account].

== Set up authentication
When you have your account set up, follow the instructions to
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/[generate and set up SSH
keys on GitHub] for proper authentication between your workstation and GitHub.

Confirm authentication is working correctly with the following command:

----
$ ssh -T git@github.com
----

== Fork and clone the Hybrid Cloud Patterns documentation repository
You must fork and set up the Hybrid Cloud Patterns documentation repository on your workstation so that you can create PRs and contribute. These steps must only be performed during initial setup.

. Fork the https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns/docs repository into your
GitHub account from the GitHub UI. Click *Fork* in the upper right-hand corner.

. In the terminal on your workstation, change into the directory where you want
to clone the forked repository.

.  Clone the forked repository onto your workstation with the following
command, replacing _<user_name>_ with your actual GitHub username.
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/docs.git
----

. Change into the directory for the local repository you just cloned.
+
----
$ cd docs
----

. Add an upstream pointer back to the Hybrid Cloud Patterns's remote repository, in this
case _docs_.
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:hybrid-cloud-patterns/docs.git
----

This ensures that you are tracking the remote repository to keep your local
repository in sync with it.
