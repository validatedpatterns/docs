== Multicloud Federated Learning

=== Background

As machine learning (ML) evolves, protecting data privacy becomes increasingly important. Since ML depends on large volumes of data, it's essential to secure that data without disrupting the learning process.

Federated Learning (FL) addresses this by allowing multiple clusters or organizations to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive data. Computation happens where the data lives, ensuring privacy, regulatory compliance, and efficiency.

By integrating FL with Open Cluster Management (OCM), this pattern provides an automated and scalable solution for deploying FL workloads across hybrid and multicluster environments.

==== Technologies 
* Open Cluster Management (OCM)
  - ManagedCluster
  - ManifestWork
  - Placement
  ...
* Federated Learning frameworks 
  - Flower
  - OpenFL
  ...
* Grafana
* OpenTelemetry

=== Why Use OCM for Federated Learning?

**Open Cluster Management (OCM)** simplifies and automates the deployment and orchestration of Federated Learning (FL) workloads across clusters:

- **Automatic Deployment & Simplified Operations**: OCM provides a unified and automated approach to running FL workflows across different runtimes (e.g., Flower, OpenFL). Its controller manages the entire FL lifecycle‚Äîincluding setup, coordination, status tracking, and teardown‚Äîacross multiple clusters in a multicloud environment. This eliminates repetitive manual configurations, significantly reduces operational overhead, and ensures consistent, scalable FL deployments.

- **Dynamic Client Selection**: OCM's scheduling capabilities allow FL clients to be selected not only based on where the data resides, but also dynamically based on cluster labels, resource availability, and governance criteria. This enables a more adaptive and intelligent approach to client participation.

Together, these capabilities support a **flexible FL client model**, where clusters can join or exit the training process dynamically, without requiring static or manual configuration.

=== Benefits

- üîí Privacy-preserving training without moving sensitive data

- ‚öôÔ∏è Automated dynamic FL client orchestration across distributed clusters

- üß© Adaptable to different FL frameworks, such as OpenFL and Flower

- üåç Scalability across hybrid and edge clusters

- üìâ Lower infrastructure and operational costs

This approach empowers organizations to build smarter, privacy-first AI solutions with less complexity and more flexibility.

=== Architecture

image::/images/multicloud-federated-learning/multicluster-federated-learning-workflow.png[multicloud-federated-learning-workflow,title="Multicloud Federated Learning Workflow",width=100%]

In this architecture, a central **Hub Cluster** acts as the aggregator, running the Federated Learning (FL) controller and scheduling workloads using Open Cluster Management (OCM) APIs like `Placement` and `ManifestWork`. 

Multiple **Managed Clusters**, potentially across different clouds, serve as FL clients‚Äîeach holding private data. These clusters pull the global model from the hub, train it locally, and push model updates back. 

The controller manages this lifecycle using custom resources and supports runtimes like Flower and OpenFL. This setup enables scalable, multi-cloud model training with **data privacy preserved by design**, requiring no changes to existing FL training code.
