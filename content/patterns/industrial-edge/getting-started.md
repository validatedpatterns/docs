# Deploying the Industrial Edge Pattern

# Prerequisites

1. An OpenShift cluster (Go to [the OpenShift console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create)). Cluster must have a dynamic StorageClass to provision PersistentVolumes. See also [sizing your cluster](../../industrial-edge/cluster-sizing).
1. (Optional) A second OpenShift cluster for edge/factory
1. A GitHub account (and a token for it with repositories permissions, to read from and write to your forks)
1. A quay account with the following repositories set as public:

    - http-ionic
    - httpd-ionic
    - iot-anomaly-detection
    - iot-consumer
    - iot-frontend
    - iot-software-sensor

The use of this blueprint depends on having at least one running Red Hat
OpenShift cluster. It is desirable to have a cluster for deploying the data
center assets and a separate cluster(s) for the factory assets.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using [Red Hat's cloud
service](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create).

## Prerequisites

For installation tooling dependencies, see [Patterns quick start](/learn/quickstart)


# How to deploy

1. Fork the [industrial-edge](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/industrial-edge) repository on GitHub.  It is necessary to fork because your fork will be updated as part of the GitOps and DevOps processes.

1. Fork the [manuela-dev](https://github.com/validatedpatterns-demos/manuela-dev) repository on GitHub.  It is necessary to fork this repository because the GitOps framework will push tags to this repository that match the versions of software that it will deploy.

1. Clone the forked copy of the `industrial-edge` repository. Create a deployment branch using the branch `v2.3`.

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:{your-username}/industrial-edge.git
   cd industrial-edge
   git checkout v2.3
   git switch -c deploy-v2.3
   ```

1. A `values-secret-industrial-edge.yaml` file is used to automate setup of secrets needed for:

   - A git repository hosted on a service such as GitHub, GitLab, or so on.
   - A container image registry (E.g. Quay)
   - S3 storage (E.g. AWS)

   DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.

   ```sh
   cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-industrial-edge.yaml
   vi ~/values-secret-industrial-edge.yaml
   ```

1. Customize the following secret values.

   ```yaml
   version: "2.0"
   secrets:
   - name: imageregistry
         fields:
       # E.G. Quay -> Robot Accounts -> Robot Login
       - name: username
         value: <Your-Robot-Account>
       - name: password
         value: <Your-RobotAccount-Password>

     - name: git
       fields:
       # Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
       - name: username
         value: <github-user>
       - name: password
         value: <github-token>

     - name: aws
       fields:
       - name: aws_access_key_id
         ini_file: ~/.aws/credentials
         ini_key: aws_access_key_id
       - name: aws_secret_access_key
         ini_file: ~/.aws/credentials
         ini_key: aws_secret_access_key
   ```

1. Customize the deployment for your cluster. Change the appropriate values in `values-global.yaml`

   ```yaml
   main:
   clusterGroupName: datacenter

   global:
   pattern: industrial-edge

   options:
      useCSV: False
      syncPolicy: Automatic
      installPlanApproval: Automatic

   imageregistry:
      account: PLAINTEXT
      hostname: quay.io
      type: quay

   git:
      hostname: github.com
      account: PLAINTEXT
      #username: PLAINTEXT
      email: SOMEWHERE@EXAMPLE.COM
      dev_revision: main

   s3:
      bucket:
         name: BUCKETNAME
         region: AWSREGION
         message:
         aggregation:
            count: 50
         custom:
         endpoint:
            enabled: false
   ```

   ```sh
   vi values-global.yaml
   git add values-global.yaml
   git commit -m "Added personal values to values-global" values-global.yaml
   git push origin deploy-v2.3
   ```

1. You can deploy the pattern using the [Validated Patterns Operator](/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/) directly. If you deploy the pattern using the Validated Patterns Operator, installed through `Operator Hub`, you will need to run `./pattern.sh make load-secrets` through a terminal session on your laptop or bastion host.

1. If you deploy the pattern through a terminal session on your laptop or bastion host login to your cluster by using the `oc login` command or by exporting the `KUBECONFIG` file.

   ```sh
   oc login
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   export KUBECONFIG=~/my-ocp-cluster/auth/kubeconfig
   ```

1. Apply the changes to your cluster from the root directory of the pattern.

   ```sh
   ./pattern.sh make install
   ```
 The `make install` target deploys the Validated Patterns Operator, all the resources that are defined in the `values-datacenter.yaml` and runs the `make load-secrets` target to load the secrets configured in your `values-secrets-industrial-edge.yaml` file.

# Validating the Environment

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to the **Operators â†’ OperatorHub** page.
2. Verify that the following Operators are installed on the HUB cluster:

   ```text
   Operator Name                  Namespace
   ------------------------------------------------------
   advanced-cluster-management    open-cluster-management
   amq-broker-rhel8               manuela-tst-all
   amq-streams                    manuela-data-lake
   red-hat-camel-k                manuela-data-lake
   seldon-operator                manuela-ml-workspace
   openshift-pipelines-operator-  openshift-operators
   opendatahub-operator           openshift-operators
   patterns-operator              openshift-operators
   ```

1. Access the ArgoCD environment

   You can find the ArgoCD application links listed under the **Red Hat applications** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

   ![ArgoCD Links](/images/ocp-applications-menu.png)

   You can also obtain the ArgoCD URLs and passwords (optional) by displaying the fully qualified domain names, and matching login credentials, for all ArgoCD instances:

   ```sh
   ARGO_CMD=`oc get secrets -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"oc get -n "}{.metadata.namespace}{" routes; oc -n "}{.metadata.namespace}{" extract secrets/"}{.metadata.name}{" --to=-\\n"}{end}' | grep gitops-cluster`
   CMD=`echo $ARGO_CMD | sed 's|- oc|-;oc|g'`
   eval $CMD
   ```

   The result should look something like:

   ```text
   NAME                       HOST/PORT                                                                                         PATH      SERVICES                   PORT    TERMINATION            WILDCARD
   datacenter-gitops-server   datacenter-gitops-server-industrial-edge-datacenter.apps.mycluster.mydomain.com          datacenter-gitops-server   https   passthrough/Redirect   None
   # admin.password
   REDACTED

   NAME                    HOST/PORT                                                                                   PATH   SERVICES                PORT    TERMINATION            WILDCARD
   factory-gitops-server   factory-gitops-server-industrial-edge-factory.apps.mycluster.mydomain.com          factory-gitops-server   https   passthrough/Redirect   None
   # admin.password
   REDACTED

   NAME                      HOST/PORT                                                                              PATH   SERVICES                  PORT    TERMINATION            WILDCARD
   cluster                   cluster-openshift-gitops.apps.mycluster.mydomain.com                          cluster                   8080    reencrypt/Allow        None
   kam                       kam-openshift-gitops.apps.mycluster.mydomain.com                              kam                       8443    passthrough/None       None
   openshift-gitops-server   openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.mycluster.mydomain.com          openshift-gitops-server   https   passthrough/Redirect   None
   # admin.password
   REDACTED
   ```

   The most important ArgoCD instance to examine at this point is `data-center-gitops-server`. This is where all the applications for the datacenter, including the test environment, can be tracked.

1. Apply the secrets from the `values-secret-industrial-edge.yaml` to the secrets management Vault. This can be done through Vault's UI - manually without the file. The required secrets and scopes are:

   - **secret/hub/git** git *username* & *password* (GitHub token)
   - **secret/hub/imageregistry** Quay or DockerHub *username* & *password*
   - **secret/hub/aws** - AWS values read from your *~/.aws/credentials*

   Using the Vault UI check that the secrets have been setup.

   For more information on secrets management see [here](/secrets). For information on Hashicorp's Vault see [here](/secrets/vault)

1. Check all applications are synchronised

Once the data center has been setup correctly and confirmed to be working, you can:

1. Add a dedicated cluster to [deploy the factory pieces using ACM](/industrial-edge/factory)
2. Once the data center and the factory have been deployed you will want to check out and test the Industrial Edge 2.0 demo code. You can find that [here](../application/)
