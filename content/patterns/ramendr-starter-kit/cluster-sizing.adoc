The OpenShift hub cluster is made of 3 Control Plane nodes and 3 Workers for the cluster; the 3 workers are standard
compute nodes.  For the node sizes we used the **m5.4xlarge** on AWS.

This pattern has only been tested on AWS only right now because of the integration of both Hive and OpenShift
Virtualization. We may publish a later revision that supports more hyperscalers.
