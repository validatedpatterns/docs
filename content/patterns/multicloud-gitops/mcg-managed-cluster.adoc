== Verification

Go to your managed cluster (edge) OpenShift console and check for the `open-cluster-management-agent` pod being launched. It might take a while for the RHACM agent and `agent-addons` to launch. After that, the OpenShift GitOps Operator is installed. On successful installation, launch the OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) console from the top right of the OpenShift console.
