== General OpenShift Minimum Requirements

OpenShift 4 has the following minimum requirements for sizing of nodes:

* *Minimum 4 vCPU* (additional are strongly recommended).
* *Minimum 16 GB RAM* (additional memory is strongly recommended, especially if etcd is colocated on Control Planes).
* *Minimum 40 GB* hard disk space for the file system containing /var/.
* *Minimum 1 GB* hard disk space for the file system containing /usr/local/bin/.

=== Medical Diagnosis Pattern OpenShift Cluster Size

The Medical Diagnosis pattern has been tested with a defined set of configurations that represent the most common combinations that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) customers are using or deploying for the x86_64 architecture.

The OpenShift cluster for the *Medical Diagnosis* pattern needs to be sized a bit larger to support the compute and storage demands of OpenShift Data Foundations and other operators that make up the pattern. The above cluster sizing is close to a *minimum* size for an OpenShift cluster supporting this pattern.  In the next few sections we take some snapshots of the cluster utilization while the *Medical Diagnosis* pattern is running.  Keep in mind that resources will have to be added as more developers are working building their applications.

The OpenShift cluster is a standard deployment of 3 control plane nodes and 3 or more worker nodes.

=== AWS Instance Types

The *Medical Diagnosis* pattern was tested with the highlighted AWS instances in *bold*.   The OpenShift installer will let you know if the instance type meets the minimum requirements for a cluster.

The message that the openshift installer will give you will be similar to this message

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Control Plane nodes and 3 Workers.  For the node sizes we used the *m5.4xlarge* on AWS and this instance type met the minimum requirements to deploy the *Medical Diagnosis* pattern successfully.

To understand better what types of nodes you can use on other Cloud Providers we provide some of the details below.

=== Azure Instance Types

The *Medical Diagnosis* pattern was also deployed on Azure using the *Standard_D8s_v3* VM size.  Below is a table of different VM sizes available for Azure.  Keep in mind that due to limited access to Azure we only used the *Standard_D8s_v3* VM size.

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Control Plane nodes and 3 Workers.
