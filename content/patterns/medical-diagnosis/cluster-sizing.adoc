= About OpenShift cluster sizing for the {med-pattern}

To understand cluster sizing requirements for the {med-pattern}, consider the following components that the {med-pattern} deploys on the datacenter or the hub OpenShift cluster:

|===
| Name | Kind | Namespace | Description

| Medical Diagnosis Hub
| Application
| medical-diagnosis-hub
| Hub GitOps management

| {rh-gitops}
| Operator
| openshift-operators
| {rh-gitops-short}

| {rh-ocp-data-first}
| Operator
| openshift-storage
| Cloud Native storage solution

| {rh-amq-streams}
| Operator
| openshift-operators
| AMQ Streams provides Apache Kafka access

| {rh-serverless-first}
| Operator
| - knative-serving (knative-eventing)
| Provides access to Knative Serving and Eventing functions

//== General OpenShift Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirements for an {ocp} cluster depend on your installation platform. For instance, for AWS, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_aws/preparing-to-install-on-aws.html#requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-aws[Installing {ocp} on AWS], and for bare-metal, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal[Installing {ocp} on bare metal].

For information about requirements for additional platforms, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing-preparing.html[{ocp} documentation].

=== About {med-pattern} OpenShift cluster size

The {med-pattern} has been tested with a defined set of configurations that represent the most common combinations that {ocp} customers are using for the x86_64 architecture.

For {med-pattern}, the OpenShift cluster size must be a bit larger to support the compute and storage demands of OpenShift Data Foundations and other Operators.
//AI:Removed a few lines from here since the content is updated to remove any ambiguity. We rather use direct links (OCP docs/ GCP/AWS/Azure)
[NOTE]
====
You might want to add resources when more developers are working on building their applications.
====

The OpenShift cluster is a standard deployment of 3 control plane nodes and 3 or more worker nodes.
