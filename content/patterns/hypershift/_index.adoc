Background::

This pattern simplifies the deployment of an hosted control plane management cluster. Use this pattern to create hosted control plane clusters.

Workflow::

* Install multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator
* Create an instance of the `MultiClusterEngine` to enable `hypershift`
* Create an S3 bucket that hosted control plane will use for OpenID Connect (OIDC)
