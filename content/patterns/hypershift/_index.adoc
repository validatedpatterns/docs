= About the {hcp-pattern} ({hcp})

Background::

This pattern simplifies the deployment of an {hcp} or hosted control plane cluster. Use this pattern to create hosted  control plane clusters.

Workflow::

* Install multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator
* Create an instance of the `MultiClusterEngine` to enable `hypershift`, which is a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[technology preview feature].
* Install the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes - Amazon S3 Operator
* Create an S3 bucket that hosted control plane will use for OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Create a buildconfig and imagestream that provide the HyperShift cli (`hypershift`) as an imagestream to be used in further automation if desired.

== About the solution elements

The solution enables the rapid provisioning of {hcp}.

The {hcp-pattern} uses the following products and technologies:

* {rh-ocp} for container orchestration
* {rh-gitops}, a GitOps continuous delivery (CD) solution
* The {rh-mce} Operator, the multicluster-engine provider
* {ack-s3-op}, an S3 storage controller
