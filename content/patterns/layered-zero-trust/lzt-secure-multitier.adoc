= Use case: Secure multi-tier applications

This use case demonstrates securing a common application design pattern: a frontend application using a database for persistent storage.

The Layered Zero Trust Pattern includes the `qtodo` application, which demonstrates a secure just-in-time (JIT) credential mechanism.

Instead of relying on static credentials stored within the application, the `qtodo` application uses a JIT method to dynamically fetch database credentials from a central credential store.

[id="lazt-application-architecture"]
== Application components and architecture

The `qtodo` application consists of the following key components and their security roles:

* The `qtodo` application: A link:https://quarkus.io[Quarkus-based] frontend application protected by OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. Users are managed in an external identity store which uses Red{nbsp}Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK).

* PostgreSQL: The relational database used by the `qtodo` application. Its credentials are dynamically generated and stored within HashiCorp Vault.

* External Identity store: Contains the provisioned users and configured OIDC clients that enable access to the `qtodo` frontend.

* HashiCorp Vault:

  * Secrets store: Stores sensitive values for components, including PostgreSQL and RHBK.

  * Workload authentication: Implements Zero Trust Workload Identity (ZTWIM) principles by using JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication. It assigns an identity to the `qtodo` application, allowing it to communicate with HashiCorp Vault and obtain the necessary PostgreSQL credentials.

* link:https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-helper[spiffe-helper]: A supplemental sidecar component for the `qtodo` application used to dynamically fetch JWT-based identities from the SPIFFE Workload API.

[id="lzt-exploring-qtodo"]
== Exploring the qtodo application

The `qtodo` application is a key component of the Layered Zero Trust Pattern, demonstrating the secure JIT fetching of credentials. To explore how the application implements Zero Trust principles, use the {ocp} web console of the Hub cluster to investigate the resources in the `qtodo` project.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Projects* page and select the `qtodo` project. This namespace contains the `qtodo` Quarkus application and the `qtodo-db` PostgreSQL database.
. Select *Workloads* -> *Pods* from the left-hand navigation bar. Explore both the `qtodo` and `qtodo-db` pods.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `qtodo` pod uses a series of init containers and sidecar containers to supply the application with the credentials required for operation.

[id="lzt-locate-app"]
=== Locating the application address

You can access the `qtodo` application through the {ocp} route.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Projects* page and select the `qtodo` project.
. Select *Networking* -> *Routes* from the left-hand navigation bar. Note the URL for the `qtodo` application in the *Location* column.
. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the `qtodo` application URL.
. The RHBK login page appears.

[id="lzt-locate-app-credentials"]
=== Locating the application credentials

The default External Identity Provider, RHBK, is provisioned with two users: `qtodo-admin` and `qtodo-user`. You can find the initial credentials in a Secret within the `keycloak-system` namespace called `keycloak-users`.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Projects* page and select the `keycloak-system` project.
. Select *Workloads* -> *Secrets* from the left-hand navigation bar.
. Select the `keycloak-users` secret.
. Click the *Reveal values* link to see the credentials.

[id="lzt-access-qtodo"]
=== Accessing the application

.Procedure

. Navigate to the RHBK login page, as described in the xref:lzt-locate-app[Locate the application's address] section.

. Enter the username and password for one of the users, using the values found in the xref:lzt-locate-app-credentials[Locate the application credentials] section.

. After you log in, follow the on-screen instructions to change the temporary password.

. Set a new password and confirm the change.
+
After the password change is complete, the `qtodo` application appears.

[id="lzt-verify-integration"]
=== Verifying integration

The `qtodo` application uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage. You can verify that the application is correctly integrated with the database by creating a new to-do item.

.Procedure
. In the `qtodo` application, add new items to the list of to-dos and remove existing items.
. Refresh the page to verify that the items persist.

By successfully modifying the list, you confirm that the integration between the Quarkus application and the PostgreSQL database—using credentials sourced dynamically from HashiCorp Vault—was successful.
