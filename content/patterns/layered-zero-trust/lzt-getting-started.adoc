[id="lzt-deploying-lzt-pattern"]
= Deploying the Layered Zero Trust pattern

Follow the instructions in this section to configure and deploy the Layered Zero Trust pattern.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster with publicly signed certificates for Ingress
* A GitHub account and a token for it with repositories permissions, to read from and write to your forks.
* Access to podman (or docker) for execution of the container images used by `pattern.sh` script for provisioning.
* Useful additions:

** The Helm binary, for instructions, see link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm]
** Additional installation tool dependencies. For details, see link:https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Patterns quick start].

== Repository setup

Follow these instructions for setting up the project repository:

. Fork the layered-zero-trust repository from GitHub. You must fork the
repository because your fork is updated as part of the GitOps and DevOps
processes.
. Clone your forked repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/layered-zero-trust.git
----

. Go to your repository: Ensure you are in the root directory of your
Git repository by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd </path/to/your/repository>
----

. Set up upstream remote repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote add -f upstream git@github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git
----

. Verify the setup of your remote repositories by running the following
command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote -v
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
origin  git@github.com:<your-username>/layered-zero-trust.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<your-username>/layered-zero-trust.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git (push)
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include
credentials. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-layered-zero-trust.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To prevent your secrets from being pushed to your Git repository,
the command places the `values-secret.yaml` file in your home directory.
This file is derived from the `values-secrets.yaml.template` file, which
is located in the pattern’s top-level directory. When creating new
patterns, you should add your secrets to the `values-secret.yaml` file
in your home directory.
====

. Create a new feature branch, for example `my-branch` from the `main`
branch for your content:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git checkout -b my-branch main
----

. (Optional) To customize the execution of the pattern, optionally change
the Helm values files and then commit the changes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git add <files-you-changed>
$ git commit -m "Pattern customization"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The following configuration files define the behavior and settings
of the various components in the Layered Zero Trust pattern. You can
customize these files to fit your specific deployment needs.

* `values-global.yaml`: Global pattern configuration
* `values-hub.yaml`: Hub cluster specific configuration
* `values-secret.yaml`: Secret values (created from template)
* `values-<environment>.yaml`: Environment-specific overrides (AWS, Azure, GCP)
====

. Push the changes from your local branch to your forked repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin my-branch
----

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the pattern by using the pattern.sh file

Deploy the Layered Zero Trust pattern using the `pattern.sh` script.

. Login to your OpenShift cluster:

.. By using the `oc` CLI:
* Get an API token by visiting `pass:[https://oauth-openshift.apps.<your-cluster>.<domain>/oauth/token/request]`.
* Log in with the retrieved token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --token=<retrieved-token> --server=https://api.<your-cluster>.<domain>:6443
----

.. By using KUBECONFIG:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Run the pattern deployment script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make install
----

[id="lzt-verify-deployment"]
=== Verify the deployment

You can use the OpenShift console and ArgoCD applications to verify the
deployment.

. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to Operators → Installed
Operators page.
. Check that Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator is installed in the
openshift-operators namespace and its status is Succeeded.
. Use the Application Launcher within the OpenShift console to confirm
that all applications have synchronized successfully to both Hub and
Cluster Argo CD instances.
