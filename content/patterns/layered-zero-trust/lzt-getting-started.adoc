[id="lzt-deploying-lzt-pattern"]
= Deploying the Layered Zero Trust pattern

Follow these instructions to configure and deploy the Layered Zero Trust pattern.

.Prerequisites

* An {ocp} 4.19 or newer cluster with:

.. publicly signed certificates for Ingress.
.. default `StorageClass` which provides dynamic `PersistentVolume` storage.

* To customize the default configuration, you must have a GitHub account and a token with repositories permissions, to read from and write to your forks.

* Access to Podman (or Docker) for execution of the container images used by `pattern.sh` script for provisioning.

* Fulfill the general link:https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/#_prerequisites[prerequisites for Validated Patterns].

* Depending on the characteristics of your cluster, you might need additional hardware resources for the Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) component.
For a single-node cluster, you can start with 4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory, and 120 GB of storage.
+
For more details about ACM sizing, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.14/html-single/install/index#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your cluster].

* (Optional) The Helm binary, for instructions, see link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm].

[NOTE]
====
The Layered Zero Trust pattern's default deployment assumes that none of its components have been installed previously. Verify that your {ocp} environment does not already contain any of xref:/patterns/layered-zero-trust/index.html#architecture [the listed components] before proceeding.

[id="lzt-repository-setup"]
== Repository setup

Follow these instructions for setting up the project repository:

. Fork the layered-zero-trust repository from GitHub. You must fork the repository because your fork is updated as part of the GitOps and DevOps processes.
. Clone your forked repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/layered-zero-trust.git
----

. Go to your repository: Ensure you are in the root directory of your
Git repository by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd </path_to_your_repository>
----

. Set up upstream remote repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote add -f upstream git@github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git
----

. Verify the setup of your remote repositories by running the following
command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote -v
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
origin  git@github.com:<your_username>/layered-zero-trust.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<your_username>/layered-zero-trust.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust.git (push)
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include
credentials. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-layered-zero-trust.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To prevent pushing secrets to your Git repository, the command places the `values-secret.yaml` file in your home directory.
You derive this file from the `values-secrets.yaml.template` file located in the pattern's top-level directory.
When you create new patterns, add your secrets to the `values-secret.yaml` file in your home directory.
====

. Create a new feature branch, for example `my-branch` from the `main`
branch for your content:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git checkout -b my-branch main
----

. (Optional) To customize the execution of the pattern, optionally change
the Helm values files and then commit the changes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git add <files_you_changed>
$ git commit -m "Pattern customization"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The following configuration files define the behavior and settings of the various components in the Layered Zero Trust pattern.
You can customize these files to fit your specific deployment needs.

* `values-global.yaml`: Global pattern configuration
* `values-hub.yaml`: Hub cluster specific configuration
* `values-secret.yaml`: Secret values (created from template)
* `values-<environment>.yaml`: Environment-specific overrides (AWS, Azure, GCP)
====

. Push the changes from your local branch to your forked repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin my-branch
----

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the pattern by using the pattern.sh file

Deploy the Layered Zero Trust pattern by using the `pattern.sh` script.

. Login to your {ocp} cluster:

.. By using the `oc` CLI:
* Get an API token by visiting `pass:[https://oauth-openshift.apps.<your_cluster>.<domain>/oauth/token/request]`.
* Log in with the retrieved token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --token=<retrieved_token> --server=https://api.<your_cluster>.<domain>:6443
----

.. By using KUBECONFIG:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Run the pattern deployment script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make install
----

[id="lzt-verify-deployment"]
=== Verify the deployment

The Layered Zero-Trust pattern provisions every component and manages them through {ocp} GitOps. After you deploy the pattern, verify that all components are running correctly.

The Layered Zero-Trust pattern installs the following two {ocp} GitOps instances on your Hub cluster. You can view these instances in the {ocp} web console by using the **Application Selector** (the icon with nine small squares) in the top navigation bar.

. **Cluster Argo CD**: Deploys an *App-of-Apps* application named `layered-zero-trust-hub`. This application installs the pattern's components.
. **Hub Argo CD**: Manages Cluster Argo CD instance and the individual components that belong to the pattern on the hub {ocp} instance.

If every Argo CD application reports a **Healthy** status, the pattern has been deployed successfully.
