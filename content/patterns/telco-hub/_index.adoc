= About the Telco Hub pattern

The Telco Hub pattern is a GitOps-first validated pattern for deploying and operating a Telco-focused management hub on {rh-ocp}. It uses a GitOps approach to centralize multi-cluster operations, lifecycle management, and policy enforcement to simplify the deployment and Day 2 operations of Telco workloads and edge clusters.

When the pattern installation is complete, the hub cluster provides:

* A dedicated GitOps (ArgoCD) instance created to manage spoke clusters. This instance includes resource tuning for scalability and an ACM plugin for simplified creation of policies.
* Support for Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) workflows, which provide automated cluster installation and configuration.
* The Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) for integrated cluster management and upgrade capabilities.
* Centralized management of distributed telco infrastructure.

[id="telco-hub-pattern-background"]
== Background

Telco networks and cloud-native network functions (CNFs) require fast, repeatable lifecycle operations, strict dependency management, and consistent configuration across many clusters and edge sites.
This pattern packages a production-ready, GitOps-based hub that uses validated upstream telco-reference CRs and applies environment-specific Kustomize overlays so Operators deploy and manage Telco platforms consistently.


[id="telco-hub-pattern-use-cases"]
== Use Cases

* **Telco Edge Hub Management**: Deploy and manage multiple edge clusters from a central hub
* **Zero Touch Provisioning**: Automated cluster installation and configuration via ZTP workflow
* **Multi-Cluster Operations**: Centralized management of distributed telco infrastructure
* **GitOps Workflows**: Infrastructure-as-code with automated deployment and synchronization

[id="telco-hub-pattern-other-technologies"]
== Other technologies

* Support for disconnected (air-gapped) environments through local registries, cluster proxy configuration, and image mirroring (`ImageSetConfiguration`).
* A dedicated GitOps (ArgoCD) instance that includes resource tuning for scalability and an ACM plugin for simplified creation of policies for managed clusters.
