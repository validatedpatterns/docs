=== Understanding the Makefile

The Makefile is the entrypoint for the pattern. We use the Makefile to bootstrap the pattern to the cluster. After the initial bootstrapping of the pattern, the Makefile isn't required for ongoing operations but can often be useful when needing to make a change to a config within the pattern by running a `make upgrade` which allows us to refresh the bootstrap resources without having to tear down the pattern or cluster.

[id="about-make-install-make-deploy-troubleshooting"]
==== About the make install and make deploy commands

Running `make install` within the pattern application triggers a `make deploy` from `<pattern_directory>/common` directory. This initializes the `common` components of the pattern framework and install a helm chart in the `default` namespace. At this point, cluster services, such as {rh-rhacm-first} and {rh-gitops} are deployed.

After components from the `common` directory are installed, the remaining tasks within the `make install` target run.
//AI: Check which are these other tasks

[id="make-vault-init-make-load-secrets-troubleshooting"]
==== About the make vault-init and make load-secrets commands

The {med-pattern} is integrated with {hashicorp-vault} and {eso-op} services for secrets management within the cluster. These targets install vault from a {helm-chart} and load the secret `(values-secret.yaml)` that you created during link:../getting-started/#preparing-for-deployment[Getting Started].

If `values-secret.yaml` does not exist, make will exit with an error saying so. Furthermore, if the `values-secret.yaml` file does exist but is improperly formatted, {rh-ansible} exits with an error about being improperly formatted. To verify the format of the secret, see link:../getting-started/#preparing-for-deployment[Getting Started].

[id="make-bootstrap-make-upgrade-troubleshooting"]
==== About the make bootstrap and make upgrade commands
The `make bootstrap` command is the target used for deploying the application specific components of the pattern. It is the final step in the initial `make install` target. You might want to consider running the `make upgrade` command instead of the `make bootstrap` command directly.

Generally, running the `make upgrade` command is required when you encounter errors with the application pattern deployment. For instance, if a value was missed and the chart was not rendered correctly, executing `make upgrade` command after fixing the value would be necessary.

You might want to review the `Makefile` for the `common` and `Medical Diagnosis` components, which are located in `common/Makefile` and `./Makefile` respectively.

[id="troubleshooting-the-pattern-deployment-troubleshooting"]
=== Troubleshooting the Pattern Deployment

Occasionally the pattern will encounter issues during the deployment. This can happen for any number of reasons, but most often it is because of either a change within the operator itself or something has changed in the {olm-first} which determines which operators are available in the operator catalog. Generally, when an issue occurs with the {olm-short}, the operator is unavailable for installation. To ensure that the operator is in the catalog, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests | grep <operator-name>
----

When an issue occurs with the operator itself you can verify the status of the `subscription` and make sure that there are no warnings.An additional option is to log into the OpenShift Console, click on Operators, and check the status of the operator.

Other issues encounter could be with a specific application within the pattern misbehaving. Most of the pattern is deployed into the `xraylab-1` namespace. Other components like ODF are deployed into `openshift-storage` and the OpenShift Serverless Operators are deployed into `knative-serving, knative-eventing` namespaces.

[NOTE]
====
Use the grafana dashboard to assist with debugging and identifying the issue
====

'''
Problem:: No information is being processed in the dashboard

Solution:: Most often this is due to the image-generator deploymentConfig needing to be scaled up. The image-generator by design is *scaled to 0*;
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n xraylab-1 dc/image-generator --replicas=1
----
+
Alternatively, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the {rh-ocp} web console, and select *Workloads â†’ DeploymentConfigs*
. Select `image-generator` and scale the pod to 1 or more.
//AI: Needs review

'''
Problem:: When browsing to the *xraylab* grafana dashboard and there are no images in the right-pane, only a security warning.

Solution:: The certificates for the openshift cluster are untrusted by your system. The easiest way to solve this is to open a browser and go to the s3-rgw route (oc get route -n openshift-storage), then acknowledge and accept the security warning.

'''
Problem:: In the dashboard interface, no metrics data is available.

Solution:: There is likely something wrong with the Prometheus Data Source for the grafana dashboard. You can check the status of the data source by executing the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get grafanadatasources -n xraylab-1
----
+
Ensure that the Prometheus data source exists and that the status is available. This could potentially be the token from the service account, for example, grafana-serviceaccount, that is provided to the data source as a bearer token.

'''
Problem:: The dashboard is showing red in the corners of the dashboard panes.
+
image::medical-diagnosis-amx/medDiag-noDB.png[link="/images/medical-diagnosis-amx/medDiag-noDB.png"]

Solution:: This is most likely due to the *xraylab* database not being available or misconfigured. Please check the database and ensure that it is functioning properly.

. Ensure that the database is populated with the correct tables:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it xraylabdb-1-<uuid> bash
$ mysql -u root

USE xraylabdb;

SHOW tables;
----
+

If you are able to successfully login then your password has been configured correctly in vault, the external secrets operator and mounted to the database correctly.

'''
Problem:: The image-generator is scaled correctly, but the dashboard is not updating.

Solution:: The serverless eventing function might not be able to fetch the notifications from ODF and therefore, not triggering the knative-serving function to scale up. You may want to check the logs of the `rook-ceph-rgw-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore-a-<podGUID>` pod in the `openshift-storage` namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-storage -f <pod> -c rgw

+
You should see the `PUT` statement with a status code of `200`
