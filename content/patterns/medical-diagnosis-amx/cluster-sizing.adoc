== About OpenShift cluster sizing for the {amx-med-pattern}

The minimum requirements for an {ocp} cluster depend on your installation platform, for example:

* For AWS, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_aws/preparing-to-install-on-aws.html#requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-aws[Installing {ocp} on AWS].

* For bare-metal, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal[Installing {ocp} on bare metal].

To understand cluster sizing requirements for the {amx-med-pattern}, consider the following components that the {amx-med-pattern} deploys on the datacenter or the hub OpenShift cluster:

|===
| Name | Kind | Namespace | Description

| Medical Diagnosis Hub
| Application
| medical-diagnosis-hub
| Hub GitOps management

| {rh-gitops}
| Operator
| openshift-operators
| {rh-gitops-short}

| {rh-ocp-data-first}
| Operator
| openshift-storage
| Cloud Native storage solution

| {rh-amq-streams}
| Operator
| openshift-operators
| AMQ Streams provides Apache Kafka access

| {rh-serverless-first}
| Operator
| - knative-serving (knative-eventing)
| Provides access to Knative Serving and Eventing functions

| {rh-nfd}
| Operator
| openshift-nfd
| Manages the detection and labeling of hardware features and configuration (for example {intel-amx})

The {amx-med-pattern} also includes the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) supporting operator that is installed by OpenShift GitOps using Argo CD.

For information about requirements for additional platforms, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing-preparing.html[{ocp} documentation].

=== About {amx-med-pattern} OpenShift cluster size

The OpenShift cluster is a standard deployment of 3 control plane nodes and 3 or more worker nodes.

The recommended hardware setup:
