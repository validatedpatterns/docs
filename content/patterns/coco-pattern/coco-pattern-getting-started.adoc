== Deploying

1. Install an link:../coco-pattern-azure-requirements/[OpenShift Cluster on Azure] 

2. Update the link:../coco-pattern-azure-requirements/#_azure_configuration_required_for_the_validated_pattern[required Azure configuration and secrets]

3. `./pattern.sh make install`

4. Wait: The cluster needs to reboot all nodes at least once, and reprovision the ingress to use the let's encrypt certificates.

5. If the services do not come up use the ArgoCD UI to triage potential timeouts.

== Simple Confidential container tests

The pattern deploys some simple tests of CoCo with this pattern. 
A "Hello Openshift" (e.g. `curl` to return "Hello Openshift!") application has been deployed in three form factor.

1. A vanilla kubernetes pod at `oc get pods -n hello-openshift standard`
2. A confidential container `oc get pods -n hello-openshift secure`
3. A confidential container with a relaxed policy at `oc get pods -n hello-openshift insecure-policy`

In this case the insecure policy is designed to allow a user to be able to exec into the confidential container. 
Typically this is disabled by an immutable policy established at pod creation time.


Doing a `oc get pods` for either of the pods running a confidential container should show the `runtimeClassName: kata-remote` for the pod.

// Add a azure portal image grab next boot
Logging into azure once the pods have been provisioned will show that each of these two pods has been provisioned with it's own `Standard_DC2as_v5` virtual machine.

=== `oc exec` testing

In a OpenShift cluster without confidential containers, Role Based Access Control (RBAC), may be used to prevent users from execing into a container to mutate it.
However:

1. Cluster admins can always circumvent this capability
2. Anyone logged into the node directly can also circumvent this capability.

Confidential containers can prevent this. Running: `oc exec -n hello-openshift -it secure -- bash` will result in a denial of access, irrespective of the user undertaking the action, including `kubeadmin`.
For running this with either the standard pod `oc exec -n hello-openshift -it standard -- bash`, or the CoCo pod with the policy disabled `oc exec -n hello-openshift -it insecure-policy -- bash` will allow shell access.



=== Confidential Data Hub testing

Part of the CoCo VM is a component called the Confidential Data Hub (CDH), which simplifies access to the Trustee Key Broker service for end applications.
Find out more about how the CDH and Trustee work together https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-confidential-containers-trustee-attestation-services-solution-overview-and-use-cases[here].

The CDH presents to containers within the pod (only), via a localhost URL. The CoCo container with an insecure policy can be used for testing the behaviour.


- `oc exec -n hello-openshift -it insecure-policy -- bash` to get a shell into a confidential container

- https://github.com/validatedpatterns/coco-pattern/blob/main/charts/hub/trustee/templates/kbs.yaml[Trustee's configuration] specifies the list of secrets which the KBS can access with the `kbsSecretResources` attribute.

- Secrets within the CDH can be accessed (by default) at `http://127.0.0.1:8006/cdh/resource/default/$K8S_SECRET/$K8S_SECRET_KEY`.

- In this case `http://127.0.0.1:8006/cdh/resource/default/passphrase/passphrase` by default will return a string which was randomly generated when the pattern was deployed.

- This should be the same as result as `oc get secrets -n trustee-operator-system passphrase -o yaml | yq '.data.passphrase'` | base64 -d`

- Tailing the logs for the kbs container e.g. `oc logs -n trustee-operator-system kbs-deployment-5b574bccd6-twjxh -f` shows the evidence which is flowing to the KBS from the CDH.
