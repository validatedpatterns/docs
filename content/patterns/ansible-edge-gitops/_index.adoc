== Ansible Edge GitOps

=== Background

Organizations want to accelerate their deployment and improve delivery quality in their Edge environments, where many devices have limited or no support for GitOps practices.
Many virtual machines (VMs) and devices can be effectively managed with Ansible. This pattern demonstrates how to use an OpenShift-based Ansible Automation Platform deployment and manage Edge devices, based on collaboration with a partner in the chemical space.

This pattern uses OpenShift Virtualization (the productization of Kubevirt) to simulate the Edge environment for VMs.

==== Solution elements

* How to use a GitOps approach to manage virtual machines, either in public clouds (limited to AWS for technical reasons) or on-prem
OpenShift installations
* How to integrate AAP into OpenShift
* How to manage Edge devices using AAP hosted in OpenShift

==== Red Hat Technologies

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Kubernetes)
* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (formerly known as "`Ansible
Tower`")
* Red Hat OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
* OpenShift Virtualization (Kubevirt)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

==== Other technologies this pattern Uses

* Hashicorp Vault
* External Secrets Operator
* Inductive Automation Ignition

=== Architecture

Similar to other patterns, this pattern starts with a central management hub, which hosts the AAP and Vault components.
