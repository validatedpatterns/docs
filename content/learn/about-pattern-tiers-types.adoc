= Validated Pattern tiers in-depth

Patterns are categorized into distinct tiers: *Sandbox*, *Tested*, and *Maintained*.

The different tiers of Validated Patterns are designed to facilitate ongoing maintenance, support, and testing efforts for a pattern.
The tiering system emphasizes the requirements a pattern meets, rather than focusing on who does the maintenance.

The following table describes each pattern tier and a short description of what the tier means in practice.

|image:pattern-tier-sandbox.png[Sandbox tier]
|xref:#sandbox-tier[{sandbox-tier-first}]
|A Sandbox pattern is:

* A starting point for extending existing patterns, rather than creating new ones from scratch.
* Capable of being deployed onto a freshly installed {ocp} cluster without prior modification or tuning.
* Designed to be useful without relying on private or closed source sample applications.


|image:pattern-tier-tested.png[Tested tier]
|xref:#tested-tier[{tested-tier-first}]
|A Tested pattern is:

* A solution that undergoes a manual or automated test plan, which passes at least once for each new {ocp} minor version.
* Subject to implementation review by the patterns team to ensure its flexibility across various platforms, environments, and relevant industries.

|image:pattern-tier-maintained.png[Maintained tier]
|xref:#maintained-tier[{maintained-tier-first}]
|A Maintained pattern is:

* Rigorously tested through an automated CI pipeline to ensure functionality across {ocp} versions, catching issues such as API deprecations quickly.
* Considered a "lifecycle" of a reference architecture, not just a point-in-time snapshot, ensuring it remains current and functional.
* Built upon real-world solution architectures demonstrating business value.
* Continuously validated to ensure all integrated components work seamlessly together as good or better after upgrades.

[id="sandbox-tier"]
== Sandbox tierÂ 

The Sandbox tier serves as the entry point for onboarding new Validated Patterns.
Patterns in this tier are typically in a work-in-progress state and might have only been manually tested on a limited set of platforms.
The primary goal for patterns here is to get started with the Validated Patterns framework and establish foundational documentation.

Following are the main characteristics and requirements for patterns to be in the sandbox tier:

* *Deployability*: The pattern must be deployable onto a newly installed {ocp} cluster without requiring any modification.
* *Documentation*: The pattern must include a top-level README document highlighting the problem this pattern solves, along with an architecture diagram.
* *Support policy*: The pattern must explicitly document the support policy for the pattern. For patterns in the sandbox tier, it is often community-based best-effort support.
* *Open contribution*: The pattern should encourage contributions and should be open to collaboration from the community.

[NOTE]
====
For patterns in the process of being created, the site indicates the current state of development in the sandbox tier including the link to the source repository for the pattern.
For example, the `status` shows, `In development`, or `Finished but waiting for documentation`, or `Testing` and other similar statuses.

Following are some examples of the patterns in the sandbox tier:

* link:/amd-rag-chat-qna[OPEA Chat QnA accelerated with AMD Instinct]
* link:/virtualization-starter-kit[Virtualization Starter Kit]
* link:/federated-edge-observability[Federated Edge Observability]

[id="tested-tier"]
== Tested tier

The Tested tier provides additional assurance that a pattern is functional, reliable, and the pattern creators have put in effort to meet additional criteria.

A pattern categorized under the tested tier indicates that the pattern has been tested within the last quarter on at least the most recent long life version of {rh-ocp}.
You can view the specifics about the testing, including whether it is manual or automated, on the Status Page.

Following are the main characteristics and requirements for patterns to be in the tested tier:

* *Business use case and demo**: Must have a defined business use case with a demonstration.
* *Architecture and guides*: Must include a standardized architecture diagram and a written guide for demonstrating the pattern.
* *Test plan*: Must include a test plan covering all highlighted features, defining how to validate successful deployment and operational functionality. The test plan must pass at least once per quarter.
* *{ocp} version testing*: Must nominate and test against at least one currently supported {ocp} release.
* *Transparency*: Must create a publicly available JSON file that records the result of the latest test for each combination of pattern, platform, and {ocp} version.
* *Focus*: Primarily focuses on functionality rather than performance.

Following are some examples of the patterns in the tested tier:

* link:/rag-llm-gitops[AI Generation with LLM and RAG]
* link:/travelops[TravelOps]
* link:/retail[Retail]

[id="maintained-tier"]
== Maintained tier

The Maintained tier represents the highest level of validation for a pattern.
The Validated Patterns team prioritizes these patterns for continuous testing to ensure they remain functional across {ocp} updates and API changes.

Patterns in this tier are functional on the following versions of {ocp}:

* Latest version
* One earlier version
* Latest long-life version

Additionally, they undergo rigorous testing including continuous integration (CI) automation testing.

Following are the main characteristics and requirements for patterns to be in the maintained tier:

* *Comprehensive testing*: Must include test plan automation that runs on every change to the pattern, or on a schedule no less frequently than once per week.
* *Broad compatibility*: Must be tested on a sliding set of {ocp} releases, which includes the latest version, at least one earlier version, and the latest long-life version.
* *Timely fixes*: Must fix any breakage in a timely manner.
* *Product review*: Their architectures must be reviewed by representatives of each consumed Red{nbsp}Hat product to ensure consistency with product roadmaps.
* *Support policy documentation*: Must document their support policy.
* *No tech preview features*: Must not rely on functionality in tech-preview or hidden behind feature gates.

Following are some examples of the patterns in the maintained tier:

* link:/ansible-edge-gitops[Ansible Edge GitOps]
* link:/multicloud-gitops[Multicloud GitOps]
* link:/industrial-edge[Industrial Edge]
