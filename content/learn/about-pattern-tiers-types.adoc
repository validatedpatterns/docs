|link:/requirements/sandbox/[{sandbox-tier-first}]
|A pattern categorized under the {sandbox} tier provides you with an entry point to onboard to {solution-name-upstream}. The minimum requirement to qualify for the {sandbox} tier is to start with the patterns framework and include minimal documentation.

The patterns in this tier might be in a work-in-progress state; and they might have been manually tested on a limited set of platforms.

|link:/requirements/tested/[{tested-tier-first}]
|A pattern categorized under the {tested} tier implies that the pattern might have been recently working on at least one recent version of {rh-ocp}. Qualifying for this tier might require additional work for the pattern’s owner, who might be a partner or a motivated subject matter expert (SME).

The patterns in this tier might have a defined business problem with a demonstration. The patterns might have a manual or automated test plan, which passes at least once for each new {rh-ocp} minor version.

|image:pattern-tier-maintained.png[]
|link:/requirements/maintained/[{maintained-tier-first}]
|A pattern categorized under the {maintained} tier implies that the pattern might have been functional on all currently supported extended update support (EUS) versions of {rh-ocp}. Qualifying for this tier might require additional work for the pattern’s owner who might be a partner or a motivated SME.

The patterns in this tier might have a formal release process with patch releases. They might have continuous integration (CI) automation testing.
