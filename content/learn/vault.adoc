= Deploying HashiCorp Vault in a validated pattern

[id="prerequisites"]
= Prerequisites

You have deployed/installed a validated pattern using the instructions provided for that pattern. This should include setting having logged into the cluster using `oc login` or setting you `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and running a `./pattern.sh make install`.

[id="setting-up-hashicorp-vault"]
= Setting up HashiCorp Vault

Any validated pattern that uses HashiCorp Vault already has deployed Vault as part of the `./pattern.sh make install`. To verify that Vault is installed you can first see that the `vault` project exists and then select the Workloads/Pods:

The setup for HashiCorp Vault happens automatically as part of the `./pattern.sh make install` command.
A cronjob will run every five minutes inside the `imperative` namespace and unseal, initialize and configure the vault. The vault's unseal keys and root token will be stored inside a secret called `vaultkeys` in the `imperative` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you copy the contents of that secret offline, store it securely, and then delete it. It will not be recreated after the vault is unsealed.

An example output from running the `oc extract -n imperative secret/vaultkeys --to=- --keys=vault_data_json 2>/dev/null` command:

The vault's root token is needed to log into the vault's UI and the unseal keys are needed whenever the vault pods are restarted.
In the OpenShift console click on the nine box at the top and click on the `vault` line:

Copy the `root_token` field which in the example above has the value `hvs.VNFq7yPuZljq2VDJTkgAMs2Z` and paste it in the sign-in page:

link:/images/secrets/vault-signin.png[image:/images/secrets/vault-signin.png[Vault Sign In\]]

After signing in you will see the secrets that have been created.

link:/images/secrets/vault-secrets-engine-screen.png[image:/images/secrets/vault-secrets-engine-screen.png[Vault Secrets Engine\]]

[id="unseal"]
= Unseal

If you don't see the sign in page but instead see an unseal page, something may have happened the cluster and you need to unseal it again. Instead of using `make vault-init` you should run `make vault-unseal`. You can also unseal it manually by running `vault operator unseal` inside the `vault-0` pod in the `vault` namespace.

[id="whats-next"]
= What's next?

Check with the validated pattern instructions to see if there are further steps you need to perform. Sometimes this might be deploying a pattern on an edge cluster and checking to see if the correct Vault handshaking and updating occurs.
