== Requirements

General requirements for all Validated patterns

[id="base"]
=== Base

. Patterns *MUST* include a top-level README highlighting the business problem and how the pattern solves it
. Patterns *MUST* include an architecture drawing. The specific tool/format is flexible as long as the meaning is clear.
. Patterns *MUST* undergo an informal architecture review by a community leader to ensure that the solution has the right products, and they are generally being used as intended.
+
For example: not using a database as a message bus.
As community leaders, contributions from within Red Hat may be subject to a higher level of scrutiny
While we strive to be inclusive, the community will have quality standards and generally using the framework does not automatically imply a solution is suitable for the community to endorse/publish.

. Patterns *MUST* undergo an informal technical review by a community leader to ensure that it conforms to the link:/requirements/implementation/[technical requirements] and meets basic reuse standards
. Patterns *MUST* document their support policy
+
REVIEW: It is anticipated that most community patterns will be supported by the community on a best-effort basis, but this should be stated explicitly.
The validated patterns team commits to maintaining the framework but will also accept help.

. Patterns SHOULD include a recorded demo highlighting the business problem and how the pattern solves it
