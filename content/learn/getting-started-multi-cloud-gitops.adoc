== Getting Started with Multicloud GitOps

Multicloud GitOps is a foundational pattern that demonstrates GitOps principles for managing applications across multiple clusters. It provides:

* A GitOps framework using ArgoCD
* Infrastructure-as-Code practices
* Multi-cluster management capabilities
* Template for secure secret management

The Multicloud GitOps pattern is recommended as your first pattern because:

. It establishes core GitOps practices
. Provides a minimal but complete implementation
. Serves as a foundation for other patterns
. Demonstrates key validated patterns concepts

[NOTE]
====
Other patterns build upon these concepts, making this an ideal starting point for your validated patterns journey.
====

== Deploying the Multicloud GitOps pattern

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`. Verify that a dynamic `StorageClass` exists before creating one by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PROVISIONER:.provisioner,DEFAULT:.metadata.annotations."storageclass\.kubernetes\.io/is-default-class"
----
+
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. From the https://github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops[multicloud-gitops] repository on GitHub, click the Fork button.

. Clone the forked copy of this repository by running the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/multicloud-gitops.git
----

. Run the following command to set the upstream repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote add -f upstream git@github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops.git 
----

. Verify the setup of your remote repositories by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git remote -v
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
origin	git@github.com:<your-username>/multicloud-gitops.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<your-username>/multicloud-gitops.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops.git (push)
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials. Run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----

. Push your local branch named `my-branch` to the remote repository specified by origin by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin my-branch
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The idea of creating a local branch and pushing this to origin allows you scope to customize the base Multicloud GitOps. 
====

You can proceed to install the Multicloud GitOps pattern by using the web console or from command line by using the script `./pattern.sh` script. 

To install the Multicloud GitOps pattern by using the the web console you must first install the Validated Patterns Operator. The Validated Patterns Operator installs and manages Validated Patterns. 

//Include Procedure module here
[id="installing-validated-patterns-operator_{context}"]
== Installing the {validated-patterns-op} using the web console

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {ocp} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the {hybrid-console-first} to the *Operators* → *OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator you want. For example, type `validated patterns` to find the {validated-patterns-op}.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Select an *Update channel* (if more than one is available).

.. Select a *Version* (if more than one is available).

.. Select an *Installation mode*:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {ocp} cluster.

.Verification
To confirm that the installation is successful:

. Navigate to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

. Check that the Operator is installed in the selected namespace and its status is `Succeeded`.

//Include Procedure module here
[id="create-pattern-instance_{context}"]
== Creating the Multicloud GitOps instance

.Prerequisites
The {validated-patterns-op} is successfully installed in the relevant namespace.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

. Click the installed *{validated-patterns-op}*.

. Under the *Details* tab, in the *Provided APIs* section, in the
*Pattern* box, click *Create instance* that displays the *Create Pattern* page.

. On the the *Create Pattern* page, select *Form view* and enter information in the following fields:

** *Name* - A name for the pattern deployment that is used in the projects that you created.
** *Labels* - Apply any other labels you might need for deploying this pattern.
** *Cluster Group Name* - Select a cluster group name to identify the type of cluster where this pattern is being deployed. For example, if you are deploying the {ie-pattern}, the cluster group name is `datacenter`. If you are deploying the {mcg-pattern}, the cluster group name is `hub`.
+
To know the cluster group name for the patterns that you want to deploy, check the relevant pattern-specific requirements.
. Expand the *Git Config* section to reveal the options and enter the required information.
. Leave *In Cluster Git Server* unchanged. 
.. Change the *Target Repo* URL to your forked repository URL. For example, change `+https://github.com/validatedpatterns/<pattern_name>+` to `+https://github.com/<your-git-username>/<pattern-name>+`
.. Optional: You might need to change the *Target Revision* field. The default value is `HEAD`. However, you can also provide a value for a branch, tag, or commit that you want to deploy. For example, `v2.1`, `main`, or a branch that you created, `my-branch`.
. Click *Create*.

The {rh-gitops} Operator displays in list of *Installed Operators*. The {rh-gitops} Operator installs the remaining assets and artifacts for this pattern. To view the installation of these assets and artifacts, such as {rh-rhacm-first}, ensure that you switch to *Project:All Projects*.

The `config-demo` project when viewed through the *Hub ArgoCD* UI from the nines menu is stuck in a `Degraded` state. This is the expected behavior when installing using the OpenShift Container Platform console. 

* Run the following command to load the secrets into the vault:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ /pattern.sh make load-secrets
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must have created a local copy of the secret values file by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make load-secrets
----
====

The deployment will not take long but it should deploy successfully.

Alternatively you can deploy the Multicloud GitOps pattern by using the command line script `pattern.sh`. 

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Log in to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the `kubeconfig` file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make install
----

. Verify that the Operators have been installed.
 .. To verify, in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
 .. Check that the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace and its status is `Succeeded`.
. Verify that all applications are synchronized. Under the project `multicloud-gitops-hub` click the URL for the `hub` gitops `server`. The Vault application is not synched.
+

As part of installing by using the script `pattern.sh` pattern, HashiCorp Vault is installed. Running `./pattern.sh make install` also calls the `load-secrets` makefile target. This `load-secrets` target looks for a yaml file describing the secrets to be loaded into vault and in case it cannot find one it will use the `values-secret.yaml.template` file in the git repo to try and generate random secrets.

For more information, see section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].

.Verification of test pages

Verify that the *hello-world* application deployed successfully as follows:

. Navigate to the *Networking* -> *Routes* menu options.

. Select the *hello-world* *Project*. 

. Click on the *Location URL*. This should reveal the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Hello World!

Hub Cluster domain is 'apps.aws-hub-cluster.openshift.org'
Pod is running on Local Cluster Domain 'apps.aws-hub-cluster.openshift.org'
----

Verify that the *config-demo* application deployed successfully as follows:

. Navigate to the *Networking* -> *Routes* menu options.

. Select the *config-demo* *Project*. 

. Click on the *Location URL*. This should reveal the following:
