Open Source Technology is always evolving, and we need to be prepared to evolve with it. In OpenShift 4.18, Red Hat
promoted the new OLMv1 packaging standard to General Availability. OLM is the Operator Lifecycle Manager, a vital
component of OpenShift. Users generally do not interact with OLM as such, but they are familiar with how OpenShift
offers Operators to install on clusters and OperatorHub - all of the operators advertized there are offered as OLM
packages.

Up until this point, Validated Patterns have only supported installation via OLMv0. OLMv1 uses the same packaging
format, but places some restrictions on what the bundles can and cannot do. Further, OLMv1 requires a serviceAccount
to explicitly be named to install the bundle. This required changes to one of the framework's key charts, and that in
turn led to changes with how we manage our chart publication pipeline. This blog post will cover three topics:

* Support for OLMv1 objects (ClusterExtensions) in the Validated Patterns Framework
* Using the new vp-rbac chart with Validated Patterns
* How our chart building pipeline had to change

Please note that all of these changes are effective as of the publication of clustergroup chart version 0.9.30, so any
new installation of any publicly maintained Validated Pattern after August 8, 2025 will be able to make use of these
new features.

== Support for OLMv1 (ClusterExtensions)

Definitive explanations of what OLMv1 is can be found here: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/announcing-olm-v1-next-generation-operator-lifecycle-management[Announcing OLM v1: Next-Generation Operator Lifecycle Management]. Detailed 
information on how to create ClusterExtension objects can be found here: link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/06/02/manage-operators-clusterextensions-olm-v1[Manage operators as ClusterExtensions with OLM v1].

OLMv1 introduces a completely new Kubernetes Kind, the ClusterExtension, which functions somewhat differently than the
Subscription object that previous versions of OLM used. Further, OLMv1 requires the explicit use of a service account
with which to install the operator bundle. OLMv1 is fairly restrictive in not allowing several previously common
methods of declaring version constraints, but over time we expect more operator bundles will support being installed
via OLMv1.

OLMv1 objects are created by passing entries through the Subscriptions object. Each subscription may be an OLMv0 or
OLMv1 object. The determination on which type of object to create is based on the presence of OLMv1 specific fields.
If the object for the subscription contains a "channels", "upgradeConstraintPolicy" or "serviceAccount" key, an OLMv1
ClusterExtension object will be created. Otherwise, the framework will create an OLMv0 Subscription. Existing code
will continue to function as it has.

Here is an example of a subscription object that will create an OLMv1 ClusterExtension:

[source,yaml]
----
---
  subscriptions:
    quay-operator:
      name: quay-operator
      namespace: redhat-quay
      channels: [ "stable-3.12" ]
      serviceAccountName: quay-sa
----

The chart sees the "channels" key and the "serviceAccountName" key and knows that it should create an OLMv1 object
based on that. The name becomes the OLMv1 PackageName. You may also specify a "version" key to pin the subscription
to a specific version or range as described link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/06/02/manage-operators-clusterextensions-olm-v1#3__upgrade_a_clusterextension[here]. If you need it, the chart also understands and uses the
"upgradeConstraintPolicy" key.

Additionally, OLMv1 allows multiple channels to be added, so they key "channels" takes an array of channel names.

The final difference is the serviceAccountName. OLMv1 now requires a service account name to install each operator.
Before, the Validated Patterns framework did not have a mechanism to install serviceAccounts, roles, or role
bindings early enough for them to be used to install operators. Several patterns had their own structures for
adding these objects, but they were private to the patterns, or else not especially flexible and could not be 
changed without effectively re-writing them. Since that chart had been published under the name "rbac" in our charts
repository, we wrote a new chart that could be used by clustergroup, and could be included as a dependency in other
charts as well.

== Using vp-rbac

The new vp-rbac chart is designed to provision serviceAccounts, roles, clusterRoles, and rolebindings. It was
developed primarily to meet the needs of clustergroup for adding serviceAccounts to install operators with
fine-grained access controls, but can be used for other serviceAccounts scenarios as well.

The (simplest, though perhaps not the most secure) structure needed to install quay looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
vp-rbac:
  serviceAccounts:
    quay-sa:
      namespace: redhat-quay
      roleBindings:
        clusterRoles:
          - cluster-admin
----

The key ('quay-sa' in this case) becomes the name of the serviceAccount, and the namespace key is required.
Rolebindings can be created for roles or clusterRoles; in this case we bind quay-sa to the (pre-existing)
cluster-admin clusterRole. Rolebindings are always part of the serviceAccount structure for this chart.

The chart also supports creating roles and clusterRoles, if you need to define custom ones. Roles and clusterRoles
support multiple rules. Each rule may specify apiGroups, resources, and verbs. If a rule omits one of these keys,
they each have defaults: apiGroups defaults to [ "'\*'" ] (which includes the empty or core apiGroup); resources
similarly defaults to [ "'*'" ]; verbs defaults to [ 'get', 'list', 'watch' ] (that is, "read-only" permissions).

Here is a more complete example of what can be done with the vp-rbac structure:

[source,yaml]
----
vp-rbac:
  serviceAccounts:
    web-terminal-sa:
      namespace: web-terminal
      roleBindings:
        clusterRoles:
          - cluster-admin
    test-admin:
      namespace: aap-config
      roleBindings:
        clusterRoles:
          - cluster-admin
          - view-secrets-cms
        roles:
          - testrole
  roles:
    testrole:
      namespace: aap-config
      rules:
        - apiGroups:
            - '""'
          resources:
            - configmaps
          verbs:
            - "list"
            - "watch"
  clusterRoles:
    view-secrets-cms:
      rules:
        - apiGroups:
            - '""'
          resources:
            - secrets
            - configmaps
          verbs:
            - "get"
            - "list"
            - "watch"
----

This structure allows the creation of structures as fine-grained as you may need, and also makes it straightforward
to create a serviceAccount with admin just to experiment or as a proof-of-concept if you do not know exactly what
permissions are actually needed.

== Using vp-rbac

You can add vp-rbac to your charts by declaring it as a dependency to your chart, like this (in Chart.yaml):

[source,yaml]
----
dependencies:
  - name: vp-rbac
    version: "0.1.*"
    repository: "https://charts.validatedpatterns.io"
----

We enhanced our chart-building pipeline to be able to resolve and include chart dependencies for the charts
that we publish in link:https://charts.validatedpatterns.io[our chart repository].

We may replace some of the RBACs that we create in the patterns framework with the vp-rbac chart, but we
do not plan to do this for all of our charts as this might break backwards compatibility in some cases.

== We Want Your Feedback!

We are excited to offer support for OLMv1 fairly early in its adoption cycle; please feel free to give it a try!
If you encounter any issues with the OLMv1 feature in clustergroup, please report them link:https://github.com/validatedpatterns/clustergroup-chart/issues[here]. Any issues witht the vp-rbac chart can be reported link:https://github.com/validatedpatterns/vp-rbac-chart/issues[here].
