= About OpenShift cluster sizing for the Multicloud GitOps Pattern

The minimum requirements for an {ocp} cluster depend on your installation platform, for example:

* For AWS, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/installing_aws/preparing-to-install-on-aws.html#requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-aws[Installing {ocp} on AWS].

* For bare-metal, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal[Installing {ocp} on bare metal].

To understand cluster sizing requirements for the Multicloud GitOps pattern, consider the following components that the Multicloud GitOps pattern deploys on the datacenter or the hub OpenShift cluster:

|===
| Name | Kind | Namespace | Description

| multicloud-gitops-hub
| Application
| multicloud-gitops-hub
| Hub GitOps management

| Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
| Operator
| open-cluster-management
| Advance Cluster Management

| Red Hat OpenShift GitOps
| Operator
| openshift-operators
| OpenShift GitOps
|===

The Multicloud GitOps pattern also includes the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) supporting operator that is installed by OpenShift GitOps using Argo CD.
