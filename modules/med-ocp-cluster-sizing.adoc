[id="med-openshift-cluster-size"]
== About OpenShift cluster size for the {med-pattern}

The {med-pattern} has been tested with a defined set of configurations that represent the most common combinations that {ocp} customers are using for the x86_64 architecture.

For {med-pattern}, the OpenShift cluster size must be larger than a standard cluster to support the compute and storage demands of OpenShift Data Foundations and other Operators.

The minimum requirements for an {ocp} cluster depend on your installation platform, for example:

* For AWS, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_aws/preparing-to-install-on-aws.html#requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-aws[Installing {ocp} on AWS].

* For bare-metal, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal[Installing {ocp} on bare metal].

For information about requirements for additional platforms, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/installing-preparing.html[{ocp} documentation].

[NOTE]
====
You might want to add resources when more developers are working on building their applications.
====

The OpenShift cluster is a standard deployment of 3 control plane nodes and 3 or more worker nodes.
