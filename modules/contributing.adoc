== Contribution workflow

When you submit a PR, the https://github.com/orgs/hybrid-cloud-patterns/teams/docs[Hybrid Cloud Patterns Docs team] reviews the PR and arranges further reviews by Quality Engineering (QE), subject matter experts (SMEs), and others, as required. If the PR requires changes, updates, or corrections, the reviewers add comments in the PR. The documentation team merges the PR after you have implemented all feedback, and you have squashed all commits.
