= Deploying the Red Hat OpenShift AI Pattern

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`. See link:../../multicloud-gitops/mcg-cluster-sizing[sizing your cluster].
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/openshift-ai[openshift-ai] repository on GitHub.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/openshift-ai.git
----

//. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials. Run the following commands:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-travelops.yaml
//----
//+
//[source,yaml]
//----
//version: "2.0"
//# Ideally you NEVER COMMIT THESE VALUES TO GIT (although if all passwords are
//# automatically generated inside the vault this should not really matter)
//
//secrets:
//  - name: mysql-credentials
//    vaultPrefixes:
//    - global
//    fields:
//    - name: rootpasswd
//      onMissingValue: generate
//      vaultPolicy: validatedPatternDefaultPolicy
//
//# Uncomment the following if you want to enable HTPasswd oAuth 
//#  - name: htpasswd
//#    vaultPrefixes:
//#    - global
//#    fields:
//#    - name: htpasswd
//#      path: '/path/to/users.htpasswd'
//----
//+
//[WARNING]
//====
//Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub. If you do not want to customize the secrets, these steps are not needed. The framework generates a random password for the config-demo application.
//====
//
. If you want a peak under the covers to see what the pattern contains, you can do so with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
cat values-hub.yaml
----

But don't worry if it looks intimidating.

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator].

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the `kubeconfig` file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ./pattern.sh make install
----

[id="verify-rhoai-pattern-install"]
== Verify Red Hat OpenShift AI Pattern installation

. Verify that the Operators have been installed.
 .. To verify, in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
 .. Set your project to `All Projects` and verify the operators are isntalled and have a status of `Succeeded`.
. Verify that all applications are synchronized. Under the project `openshift-ai-hub` click the URL for the `hub` gitops `server`. 
+

+
As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].


[id="verify-rhoai-dashboards"]
== Verify installation by checking the OpenShift AI Dashboard

. Access the OpenShift AI dashboard

+
[source, terminal]
----
RHODS=https://$(oc get route -n redhat-ods-applications -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo ${RHODS}
----

You can also get to the dashboard from the OpenShift Console by selecting the application shortcut icon and then selecting the link for Red Hat OpenShift Ai

image:rhoai/rhods-application_menu.png[Application ShortCut,link="/images/rhoai/rhods-application_menu.png"]

Log in to the Dashboard using your OpenShift credentials. You will find an environment that is ready for further configuration. This pattern provides the fundamental platform pieces to support MLOps workflows. The installation of OpenShift Pipelines enables the immediate use of pipelines if that is the desired approach for deployment.
