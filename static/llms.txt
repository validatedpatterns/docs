# Validated Patterns

> Validated Patterns are GitOps-driven, automated, and rigorously tested application stacks for hybrid cloud deployments on Red Hat OpenShift. They go beyond traditional reference architectures by providing deployable, testable software artifacts with automated deployment that enhance speed, reliability, and consistency across environments.

Important notes:

- Validated Patterns are built on OpenShift Container Platform (Kubernetes) and leverage GitOps principles using ArgoCD, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), and Tekton
- They are designed for IT architects, advanced developers, and system administrators familiar with Kubernetes and OpenShift
- Patterns can be deployed using either the OpenShift-based Validated Patterns framework or the Ansible GitOps Framework (AGOF)
- All patterns require an available OpenShift 4.12+ cluster with cluster-admin privileges, at least 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and dynamic storage provisioning
- Each pattern includes values files (values-global.yaml, values-hub.yaml) for customization and secrets management without committing sensitive data to git repositories
